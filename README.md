- 1 Read from a file an "ignore list" of words to be ignored regardless of length.
# Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) through your package management system or from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads)
- [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

These really are the only required prerequisites.

# Running the applications

Note to grader: in order to run with command args, please use
sbt "run arg1 arg2 arg3 arg 4 arg5" < file input
or 
sbt "run arg1 arg2 arg3 arg 4 arg5"

with as many args as you wish.
